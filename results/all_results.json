the room.", "524": "The azalea was densely packed with flowers, and the cigarette butt fell among them, scorching a petal brown.\nWeilong stood alone in the living room until a junior maid came in and called her to breakfast.", "525": "After breakfast, she went upstairs and stood at the window of her room, gazing vacantly.", "526": "There was the rectangular grass lawn, neatly trimmed, sprinkled with dew, a bold deep green.", "527": "With sharp jerky steps, a sparrow was crossing the lawn, only to stop along the way, as if dazed by that continent of stupefying green.", "528": "Step by jerky step, it started back.", "529": "Weilong had thought that sparrows only hopped; she had never realized that they could move in long, measured strides, and she watched for a long time.", "530": "Perhaps it wasn\u2019t a sparrow?", "531": "She was still wondering when two porters passed down the garden path, puffing as they carried a red trunk through the gate.", "532": "They were followed by a middle-aged woman in a tunic and trousers of black gambiered silk; Glance\u2019s mother, apparently.", "533": "Glance came out too and just stood there.", "534": "She was waiting, it seemed, for another porter who was still inside.", "535": "Her eyes were red and swollen from crying, and her powder had turned her face to a light brown.", "536": "Weilong could only see her in profile, eyes staring straight ahead, face expressionless, a clay mask.", "537": "After watching for some time, Weilong noticed the slight twitch of a muscle running from cheek to temple.", "538": "Oh, so that was it: Glance was eating peanuts.", "539": "Every once in a while a shred of red peanut skin would pop out of the corner of her mouth.\nSuddenly Weilong didn't want to watch anymore.", "540": "She turned and opened the closet door, leaning against it.", "541": "It was dark inside the closet, and the lilac scent made her dizzy.", "542": "The air of the faraway past was in there\u2014decorous, languid, heedless of time.", "543": "In that closet there was no bright, clear morning like the one outside the window, with its flat green grass, mute frightened face, and peanut skins at the corner of the mouth\u2026 all that dirty, complicated, unreasonable reality.\nOnce Weilong had gone into that clothes closet, she stayed for two or three months, and she had lots of opportunities to dress up.", "544": "A banquet, a tea party, a concert, a mah-jongg party\u2014for her these were little more than occasions for putting on fine clothes.", "545": "She considered herself fortunate, since Madame Liang merely used her as a signboard to attract the mainstream sort of youth.", "546": "Her aunt did take her to fancy dance halls a few times, but usually she invited people over to the house.", "547": "Steeped as they are in the conservative habits of the British upper class, the young ladies of Hong Kong\u2019s great families maintain an air of dignified reserve, quite unlike Shanghai\u2019s socialites.\nMadame Liang was extremely picky about the young men who pursued Weilong, more severe even than the imperial household when it is choosing a royal son-in-law.", "548": "If the lucky half dozen who were in the running grew excessively ardent in their pursuit, Madame Liang simply took the precious goods off the shelf: none of the suitors would be allowed to go near her niece.", "549": "Then, when she had permitted one of them to get close, she swooped in with a dexterous display of charm, and recruited him for her own purposes.", "550": "When a youth paid his addresses to Madame Liang, he was like an old drunk who pretends he doesn\u2019t want a drink; in the end, he succumbed, and there he\u2019d be, deep in an affair.", "551": "Weilong got used to watching this little drama, without caring much about it.\nOne day, as she was preparing to go out, Weilong urged Glint to do up her hair quickly.", "552": "Madame Liang had assigned her favorite attendant to wait on Weilong, and Glint had quickly got a very good grasp of Weilong\u2019s temperament.", "553": "Weilong, with no family in Hong Kong to turn to, had found that Glint, though she could be quite cold-hearted, always had warm, wise advice for her.", "554": "Glint was now her trusted confidante.\n\u201cHow about the dress first and then the hair?\u201d Glint said now.", "555": "\u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll muss your hair when you pull the dress over your head.\u201d", "556": "\u201cPick out something simple,\u201d Weilong said. \u201cThe choir is going to practice in the church, and I\u2019m afraid the people there won\u2019t approve of fancy clothes.\u201d", "557": "But Glint went ahead and chose a ginger-yellow crepe cheongsam. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not a Christian, so why join the choir? Your social schedule keeps you busy all day long, and then you study till dawn. These past two weeks you\u2019ve been working so hard to get ready for your exams that you\u2019re positively wasting away! Why are you ruining your health this way?\u201d", "558": "Weilong sighed and dipped her chin to let Glint part her hair. \u201cYou say I\u2019m studying too much. But you know very well that I go out to parties just to help my aunt and keep her happy. I worked very hard for this chance to study, so now I have to do a good job and get respectable grades.\u201d", "559": "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to rain on your parade, but what is the point of graduating? You\u2019re still in secondary school, Hong Kong has only one university, and university graduates can\u2019t find work anyway! If they do find a job, it pays fifty or sixty dollars a month, and for that they have to teach in a primary school run by the church and put up with the foreign nuns\u2019 bad tempers. It\u2019s really not worth it!\u201d", "560": "\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t thought of all that? Still, I have to take what I can get!\u201d", "561": "\u201cNow don\u2019t get angry at what I\u2019m going to say. I think you should use all these social occasions to look around and find someone who\u2019ll be right for you.\u201d", "562": "Weilong smiled sarcastically. \u201cAnd who would that be, in my aunt\u2019s circle of friends? They\u2019re either young men as slippery as dance-hall playboys or the kind of old man who likes to hang around a harem. Or else they\u2019re British military men, in which case, if they\u2019re lieutenants or above, they don\u2019t want to get involved with someone from the yellow race. That\u2019s how it is in Hong Kong!\u201d", "563": "\u201cOh, now I get it!\u201d Glint responded with a sudden laugh. \u201cNo wonder you joined the choir even though you don\u2019t have any free time. They say there are quite a few college students in that group.\u201d", "564": "\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you joke about this with me,\u201d Weilong smiled. \u201cBut don\u2019t go saying anything to Aunt!\u201d", "565": "Glint was silent.", "566": "\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Weilong was insistent. \u201cDon\u2019t go spreading rumors!\u201d", "567": "Glint was startled out of her reverie. \u201cWhat do you take me for? You think I can\u2019t keep quiet about a little thing like this?\u201d She glanced around, then said quietly, \u201cMiss, you\u2019d better be careful. While you\u2019ve been looking for someone to pick, our Young Mistress, with her sharp eyes and quick fingers, has already picked one out for herself.\u201d", "568": "Weilong looked up sharply, knocking Glint\u2019s hand aside. \u201cWho do you mean?\u201d", "569": "\u201cThat Lu Somebody in your choir, the one who\u2019s good at tennis. He\u2019s a college student, isn\u2019t he? Oh, now I remember, his name is Lu Zhaolin.\u201d", "570": "Weilong\u2019s face flushed bright red; she bit her lips in silence. Finally, she said, \u201cHow do you know that she\u2026\u201d", "571": "\u201cEh! How could I not know? If it weren\u2019t for this, she wouldn\u2019t have let you join the choir in the first place. She wouldn\u2019t let you go off on your own to make friends, not even to sing with a big group of people in the church. That\u2019s the rule here. Anyone who wants to see you has to come in through the front door and pay a proper visit. And once they\u2019ve come in that way, it\u2019s easy to manage things. I thought it was strange when she didn\u2019t say anything about your joining the choir. Two weeks ago, all she could talk about was holding a garden party and inviting your choir friends, so everyone would have a chance to get acquainted. Then that Lu person went to Manila for a tennis match, and the garden party was put off. As soon as Lu came back, she started talking about it again.

A cliff hung over the empty space, guarded by a semicircular metal railing. Chuanqing was walking in front, but when he looked back he couldn\u2019t find Danzhu. He looked again, and saw her leaning against the railing. At the foot of the cliff the pines surged and billowed, along with another kind of tree that stayed leafy even in winter; the leaves of that tree flashed green on one side, white on the other. The wind swallowed everything. All over the mountain leaves were fluttering, sprinkling a silver light everywhere. When the clouds parted, the pale yellow winter moon came out; the dark white sea and sky stretched away, behind Danzhu, like a standing screen plated with mica. Danzhu was wearing a hooded cape of emerald green velvet with a white velvet lining. Even in very cold weather she liked to wear white, because the contrast with her dark complexion was so striking. Chuanqing had never seen her so dressed up before.

they  would  be  going  there,  renting  a  house,  and staying for about a year.\nThat was why she\u2019d been so busy the last few days, packing up and getting ready to go.\nAs for the Baolu project, Mr. Fan had already left Shanghai, so they\u2019d have to let it rest for the time being.\nAnd Mrs.  Xu  had  just  found  out  that  Mr.  Jiang,  Liusu\u2019s  potential  match,  had another woman in his life.\nTrying to drive a wedge between them would be no easy matter.\nAnyway, this kind of person really wasn\u2019t reliable; it might be  better  to  give  it  up.\nWhen  Third  and  Fourth  Mistress  heard  this,  they exchanged glances and smirked.\nMrs. Xu furrowed her brow and continued: \u201cMy husband has a lot of friends in Hong Kong, but the problem is that \u2018distant water can\u2019t put out a nearby fire\u2019\u2026 If Sixth Young Lady could go to Hong Kong for a bit, probably she\u2019d find a lot of opportunities.", "1823": "Over the past few years, so many Shanghainese men have gone to Hong Kong that the place is teeming with talented Shanghainese, and people are saying that young ladies from back home are very popular. If Sixth Young Lady went, there\u2019s no doubt she\u2019d find a good match. She could grab a handful and take her pick.\u201d", "1824": "Everyone felt that Mrs. Xu really had a way with words. A few days ago her grand plans had come to naught, leaving her high and dry, and yet here she was putting up a good front, etc. Old Mrs. Bai sighed. \u201cGoing to Hong Kong,\u201d she said. \u201cEasier said than done!

I agreed to help her, so I should see it through.\u201d", "1826": "At this, they all turned to one another, blinking with amazement. Even Liusu was taken aback. Mrs. Xu\u2019s volunteering to make a match for her\u2014 that had been impulsive and good-hearted, born of a real sympathy for her situation. Running around fixing things up, arranging a dinner party, inviting that Mr. Jiang\u2014such generosity was not unheard of. But paying Liusu\u2019s fare and expenses and taking her to Hong Kong\u2014 Mrs. Xu would be shelling out a lot of money, and for what? There may be lots of virtuous people in this world, but they aren\u2019t so stupid as to throw good money away for virtue\u2019s sake.", "1827": "Mrs. Xu must have a backer. Could it be a plot hatched by that Fan Liuyuan? Mrs. Xu had said that her husband had close business ties with Fan Liuyuan, and she and her husband were probably eager to help him out.

scarcely out of his mouth when Ch\u2019ang-an suddenly tipped backwards and would have toppled down if he had not caught her.\nCh\u2019ang-pai clapped his hands, laughing, while Ch\u2019un-hsi, though

you teach my daughter bad things I\u2019ll have to hold my nose and marry her to you, so you can take over our property.\nA fool like you doesn\u2019t look to me as if he\u2019d think of such a trick,

back?\nGet out of my sight right away, don\u2019t wait for my men to drive you out with rods.\u201d\nSo saying, she pushed her son and daughter out and then left the room herself, supported by a slave

open the letters and just sent them back.", "2922": "Thus her school life came to an end.\nSometimes she felt the sacrifice was not worth it and was secretly sorry, but it was too late.", "2923": "She gradually gave up all thought of self-improvement and kept to her place.", "2924": "She learned to make trouble, play little tricks, and interfere with the running of the house.", "2925": "She often

like a tender bunch of vegetables that had been salted.\nSome people tried to make matches for her.", "2929": "If the other side was not well off, Ch\u2019i-ch\u2019iao would always suspect it wanted

the balcony.", "3707": "The breeze was cool on his skin: most likely his face had been pretty red a moment before.", "3708": "Now he was even more troubled.", "3709": "He\u2019d just put an end to his

land.\u201d", "3718": "When he returned home and saw those \u201cold friends\u201d again, the first time they met they were bosom friends, the second time mere acquaintances, and by the third time they were strangers to each other.\nAnd yet, when it came to this Wang Jiaorui, hadn\u2019t Shihong done pretty well for himself by marrying her?", "3719": "Of course, Wang Shihong\u2019s father had money; if a man had to forge ahead on his own, as Zhenbao did, such a woman would be a major impediment.", "3720": "And he wasn\u2019t easygoing like Wang Shihong, who let a woman flout every rule.",

because her husband couldn\u2019t control her; if Wang Shihong had managed to get a handle on her, she wouldn\u2019t be quite so unruly.\nZhenbao leaned on the railing, his arms folded.", "3724": "Down below, an electric tram with a brightly burning lamp stopped at the entrance of the building.", "3725": "Several people got on and off, and the lamp moved away.", "3726": "Wide and quiet, the street stretched beyond him; the only light was from a little restaurant on the first floor.", "3727": "Two leaves skittered by in the wind like ragged shoes not worn by anyone, just walking along by themselves.", "3728": "So many people in the world\u2014but they won\u2019t be coming home with you.", "3729": "When night fell and silence took over\u2014or when, as could happen at any time, you stood at the brink of death\u2014there in the dark, you needed a wife you really loved, otherwise there would be nothing but loneliness.", "3730": "Zhenbao didn\u2019t think this through clearly, but

in the breeze your cough is going to get worse.\u201d", "3733": "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Jiaorui, unwrapping the towel and shaking out her hair.\nZhenbao figured that since Shihong was leaving the next day, the couple would want to speak in privacy.", "3734": "Raising a hand to disguise a forced yawn, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go to bed now.

He must have left already.", "3739": "Taking off his coat and hanging it on the rack, Zhenbao heard Jiaorui dial a phone number in the other room. \u201cPlease ask Mr. Sun to come to the phone,\u201d she said.", "3740": "Zhenbao listened. He heard her ask, \u201cIs this Timmy? No, I\u2019m not going out today, I\u2019m at home waiting for a boyfriend.\u201d She started to giggle. \u201cWho is he? I\u2019m not telling you. Why should I tell you?\u2026 Ah, so you\u2019re not interested? Not even interested in yourself, are you\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019m waiting for him to come for tea at five o\u2019clock. I\u2019m waiting specially for him, so don\u2019t come over.\u201d", "3741": "Zhenbao went to his room without waiting for her to finish. His brother wasn\u2019t there, or in the bathroom either. He went out to see if he was on the balcony, and Jiaorui emerged from the living room to greet him. \u201cDubao asked me to tell you that he\u2019s making the rounds of the used bookstores to see if he can find some books.\u201d", "3742": "\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d said Zhenbao. He took a good long look. She was wearing a long dress that trailed on the floor, a dress of such intense, fresh, and wet green that anything it touched turned the same color.", "3743": "When she moved a little, the air was streaked with green. The dress had been cut a bit too small, it seemed: the seams along the side were split open an inch and a half, then laced together, in a crisscross pattern, over a green satin strip that didn\u2019t fully cover a startling pink slip.", "3744": "Looked at too long, those eye-popping colors would prove blinding. Only Jiaorui could wear a dress like that with such utter insouciance.\n\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d she asked, turning back into the living room.", "3745": "She sat down at the table, and lifted the pot to pour the tea.", "3746": "The table was set for two, with a plate of butter biscuits and toast.", "3747": "Zhenbao stood by the glass door.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there a guest coming?\u201d", "3748": "\u201cWe won\u2019t wait for him.

The amah came in. \u201cMake two cups of green tea,\u201d Jiaorui ordered.\n\"Ask her to bring another teacup and plate while she\u2019s at it,\u201d said Zhenbao, \u201cfor the guest who\u2019s coming later.\"", "3756": "Jiaorui gave him a sharp look. \u201cWho is this guest that you\u2019re so anxious about? Amah, bring me a pen and a piece of paper.\u201d", "3757": "She dashed off a note, then pushed it across to Zhenbao. Two lines, simple and succinct: Dear Timmy, So very sorry, but I have something to do today. I\u2019ve gone out.\u2014 Jiaorui.", "3758": "She folded the paper over and gave it to the amah. \u201cMr. Sun will come in a little while. When he does, give this to him and tell him I\u2019m not home.\u201d", "3759": "The amah went out. Zhenbao took a biscuit. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy go to so much trouble, asking a man to come to your house, then turn him away empty-handed?\u201d", "3760": "Jiaorui leaned forward, carefully considering the selection of biscuits on the plate, but she couldn\u2019t find any that she liked. \u201cWhen I asked him to come I didn\u2019t plan to turn him away.\u201d", "3761": "\u201cOh? A last-minute decision?\u201d", "3762": "\u201cDon\u2019t you know the saying?

Zhenbao held the glass in both hands without drinking. His eyes were fixed on the tea but his mind was elsewhere, working things out.", "3764": "Jiaorui was still carrying on with that Mr. Sun behind her husband\u2019s back, and evidently she was worried that Zhenbao would see what was going on. That\u2019s why she\u2019d put on this sweet act today. She wanted to win him over so he\u2019d keep his mouth shut.", "3765": "But in fact Zhenbao had no intention of interfering in their private lives. It wasn\u2019t that his bond with Wang Shihong was too weak\u2014even if they\u2019d been blood brothers, stirring up disputes between a husband and wife was not his style.", "3766": "Even so, this woman could cause a lot of trouble. Zhenbao redoubled his caution.\nJiaorui set down her tea glass and rose to get a jar of peanut butter from the cabinet.", "3767": "\u201cI\u2019m a trashy person, and I like to eat trashy things.\u201d", "3768": "\u201cOh, my!

Very familiarly, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you another time, okay?\u201d\nHe looked at her with shining eyes and laughed.\nImmediately after, he was sorry\u2014as if he\u2019d gotten too excited while talking and sprayed spit in someone\u2019s face.\nHe had always taken this Miss Ashe for a keen observer.\nShe was young and she had nothing, not even a personality; she was just waiting for the approach of everything in the world.\nAlready its huge shadow had fallen across her otherwise expressionless features.\nJiaorui was young, and she had all sorts of things, but somehow they didn't count.", "4003": "She seemed scatterbrained, like a child who goes out and picks dozens of violets, one by one, gathers them into a bunch and tosses them all away.", "4004": "Zhenbao had only his future to bank on, a future he'd prepared for all on his own.", "4005": "How could he bear to see it thrown to the wind?", "4006": "Rich young men and women are free to be careless\u2014security is an inheritance for them\u2014but for him it was not so easy!", "4007": "The four of them walked slowly down the same street, Mrs. Ashe in the safety and comfort of a room full of flowered wallpaper, while the three young people faced menace on every side\u2014it boomed beneath them like a drum.\nIt was not yet dark, but the neon lights were shining; in the daylight they looked even more artificial, like costume jewelry.", "4008": "They passed a shop with lamps for sale, innumerable lamps under the neon glow, the whole place blazing with light.", "4009": "Behind the tin grill of a snack shop, a waitress leaned forward to pick up a piece of pastry; her rouge-red cheeks looked good enough to eat.", "4010": "Did old people also see it like that?", "4011": "Walking next to the old woman, Zhenbao couldn\u2019t help feeling the brevity of youth.", "4012": "A row of shiny round-head spikes, their heads indented on four sides, marked off a pedestrian crosswalk; beside them the asphalt road looked as dark and soft as rubber.", "4013": "Zhenbao swayed along, letting his body go.", "4014": "He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was his own gait that was rubbery or the road underfoot.\nMrs. Ashe praised the fabric of Jiaorui\u2019s dress.", "4015": "Then she said, \u201cI saw a piece like that, last time I was at the Huilou fine goods shop.", "4016": "Dolly turned it down because she thought it was too dark.", "4017": "I still wanted to buy it, but then I thought, well, I don\u2019t often have an occasion for wearing such clothes\u2026\u201d", "4018": "She didn\u2019t seem to feel that what she said was sad, but the others all fell silent, unable to respond.", "4019": "\u201cSo Mr. Ashe must be very busy?\u201d Zhenbao finally asked.\n\u201cOh, yes.

 the  only hint of a twist or turn came at the tips of her girlish breasts and the jutting bones  of  her  hips.\nWhen  a  breeze  stirred,  and  her  dress  swept  out  behind her, it made her look thin and frail.\nHer face was soft and very pretty, and yet  the  main  effect  was  of  whiteness.\nYanli\u2019s  father  had  died,  and  her family\u2019s  fortunes  had  gone  into  decline,  but  at  one  time  they  had  been  a wealthy  merchant  family,  so  the  two  of  them  had  similar  family backgrounds.\nThe young lady was twenty-two years old and would soon be graduating from college.\nHer college wasn\u2019t a very good one, just the best she could get into, but  Yanli  was  a  good  student  in  a  mediocre  place;  she studied hard and didn\u2019t associate much with her classmates.\nHer whiteness, like  a  portable  hospital  screen,  separated  her  from  the  bad  things  in  her environment.\nIt  also  separated  her  from  the  things  in  her  books.\nFor  ten years  now  Yanli  had  gone  to  school,  diligently  looking  up  new  words, memorizing  charts,  copying  from  the  blackboard,  but  between  her  and everything  else  there  always  seemed  to  be  a  white  membrane.\nIn  middle school,  she\u2019d  received  letters  from  some  boys\u2014the  elder  brothers  of  her classmates, for the most part.\nWhen her family found out about it, they told her not to get involved with people like that.\nYanli had never written back.\nZhenbao planned to marry her in two months, after her graduation.", "4114": "During this time, he took her out to the movies a few times.", "4115": "Yanli rarely spoke or raised her head and always walked a little behind him.", "4116": "She knew very well that according to modern etiquette she should walk in front, let him help her put on her coat and wait on her, but she was uncomfortable exercising her new rights.", "4117": "She hesitated, and this made her seem even slower and more awkward.", "4118": "Zhenbao himself wasn't a natural-born gentleman, but he had worked hard to learn the part: he took the matter seriously and thought Yanli quite remiss in this regard.", "4119": "Fortunately, a shy shrinking manner in a young girl is not too unpleasant.\nThe engagement was short, and secretly Yanli was very disappointed;\nshe\u2019d always heard that these were the best days of one\u2019s life.", "4120": "Even so, she was very happy when the wedding day arrived.", "4121": "That morning, combing her hair while still half asleep, she lifted her arms up, looked in the mirror, and felt a strange sense of invigoration\u2014as if she\u2019d been crammed into a glass test tube and was now pushing her head up to pop the lid off, ready to leap from the present into future.", "4122": "The present was good, but the future would be better.", "4123": "Yanli stretched her arms out of the window of the future, and a vast wind blew through her hair.\nThe wedding was at Yi Pin Xiang Restaurant, with the banquet at Dongxing Restaurant.", "4124": "Zhenbao liked to make a good impression, but he was also careful with money\u2014good enough was good enough for him.", "4125": "He rented a new house not far from his office and had his mother come from Jiangwan to live with them.", "4126": "He spent most of his earnings on work-related socializing, so the household budget was very tight.", "4127": "His mother and Yanli got along fairly well, but Zhenbao had many complaints about Yanli and no one to tell them to.", "4128": "Yanli didn\u2019t like exercise; even \u201cthe best sort of indoor exercise\u201d had no appeal for her.", "4129": "Zhenbao made a real effort to be a good husband and help her like it, but he didn\u2019t feel much physical attraction.", "4130": "At first she\u2019d seemed cute, one undeveloped breast nestling in his hand like a sleeping bird with its own lightly beating heart, its sharp beak pecking at his palm, firm yet without strength\u2014but then his hand had also lost its strength.", "4131": "Later on even this little bit of girlish beauty was gone.", "4132": "Gradually Yanli settled into her new environment, and as she did, she turned into a very dull wife.\nZhenbao started going to prostitutes.\nOnce every three weeks\u2014his life was, in every respect, well regulated.\nHe and some friends would take rooms in a hotel and call in the women; they\u2019d tell their families they\u2019d gone to Suzhou and Hangzhou on business.\nHe wasn\u2019t particular about faces, but he liked girls who were dark and a little bit plump.\nHe wanted them fleshy and ashamed, which was his way of taking revenge on Rose and Wang Jiaorui, though he wouldn\u2019t let himself view it that way.\nIf such a thing did enter his mind, he immediately reproached himself for desecrating treasured memories.\nFor these two lovers, he reserved a sensitive spot, a sacred corner of his heart.\nWang Jiaorui and Rose gradually became so mixed up in his mind that they became one: a naive, passionate girl who had doted on him, a girl with no brains, or anything to cause him any trouble, though he\u2014with his self-denying logic and steely, superhuman will\u2014had left her.\nYanli had no idea about the prostitutes.", "4133": "She loved him simply because he, among so many others, happened to be her man.", "4134": "She was always saying things like \u201cWait and ask Zhenbao about it\u201d or \u201cBetter take an umbrella, Zhenbao said it\u2019s going to rain.\u201d", "4135": "Zhenbao was her God, and assuming that role was no problem for him.", "4136": "When Yanli made a mistake, he\u2019d reprimand her in front of other people, and if something escaped his attention, it never failed to escape his mother\u2019s.", "4137": "Each time she was scolded in front of the maidservant, Yanli could feel her authority crumbling away beneath her.", "4138": "When her orders weren\u2019t carried out, she was again to blame.", "4139": "She hated the disdain in the servants\u2019 eyes, and in dealing with them she protected herself by knitting her brows and pouting before she even spoke, her whole face a study in childish chagrin.", "4140": "When she threw a tantrum, she always seemed to be talking back, like a maid or a concubine who has grown used to occupying the bottom rung.\nThe only time Yanli managed to be mistress of the house\u2014for a few days at least\u2014was when the servants were new, so she liked getting new servants as often as she could.", "4141": "Zhenbao\u2019s mother told everyone that her daughter-in-law was useless: \u201cPoor Zhenbao, working so hard at his job to support the family, but when he comes home he\u2019s pestered with all sort of domestic details.

Soon they were irritated with each other all the time.", "4143": "Fortunately, Zhenbao played peacemaker and the embarrassment of a direct confrontation was avoided, but his mother sullenly insisted on moving back to Jiangwan.
