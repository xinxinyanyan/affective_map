Western) forms of patriotism, science, and individual rights, including women\u2019s rights.", "5": "A year and a half before Eileen Chang\u2019s birth, the movement had taken to the streets: in the pivotal May Fourth demonstrations, outraged students protested the Western powers\u2019 high-handed treatment of China at the close of WWI (Japan\u2019s occupation of Germany\u2019s colonial territories in China was sanctioned, and foreigners\u2019 imperial privileges in China were preserved).", "6": "Then the protests widened into a broad critique of various domestic ills.", "7": "Many intellectuals felt that China\u2019s military weakness was at root a cultural problem: effective reform would have to be directed at basic habits and thinking.\nThese huge changes were emancipatory for broad swathes of Chinese society, and excruciating to others.", "8": "This can be seen from Eileen Chang\u2019s family story.", "9": "Her family belonged to the late-Qing elite and had once been quite wealthy and powerful.", "10": "Her paternal great-grandfather was Li Hongchang, the nineteenth-century statesman who had played a leading role in the Qing dynasty\u2019s drive to modernize, after the humiliating defeat it had suffered in the Opium Wars.", "11": "For his descendants, Li was the equivalent of a famous and effective prime minister, not too far back in the family tree.", "12": "Chang\u2019s father, however, was an entirely different sort of aristocrat: he smoked opium, kept a fawning concubine, and, when his temper flared, beat up the members of his own family, especially the women.", "13": "This happened with fair regularity, since his wife and his sister, Eileen\u2019s maiden aunt, were daring and independent in the New Woman mode: they traveled to Europe and remained there for several years, leaving Eileen and her younger brother behind in the care of the family patriarch.", "14": "Nonetheless, by the late 1920s, Chang\u2019s mother had rejoined her family and was living with them in a Western-style house in Shanghai.", "15": "Her husband overdosed on morphine, and went to a hospital to recover his health, leaving her free to manage the household and supervise her children\u2019s education.", "16": "\u201cThis was basically the only time in my life when I enjoyed the lifestyle of a Westernized young lady,\u201d Chang wrote in her memoirs.", "17": "There were lessons in art, music, and English.", "18": "And when the girl was enrolled in school, her mother simply transcribed her English name into Chinese\u2014yielding a Chinese given name with a slightly foreign and (according to the writer herself) pleasantly awkward feel.", "19": "But after her father returned from his hospital stay, the conflicts between the self-possessed, Westward-leaning mother and the self-destructive, reactionary father proved irreconcilable: they divorced in 1930.\nChang\u2019s family world was now ostensibly split in two\u2014 father\u2019s dark, smoky  lair;  mother\u2019s  bright,  modern  apartment\u2014  but  for  a  sensitive teenager  this  was  not  a  simple  split.", "20": "Her  father\u2019s  nostalgic  \u201cafternoon\u201d world  was  subtly  appealing,  while  her  mother\u2019s  brisk  coolness  could  be altogether  alienating.", "21": "Still,  at  the  age  of  eighteen,  Chang  fled  her  father\u2019s house and sought refuge with her mother.", "22": "She was making her escape after a six month ordeal: she\u2019d been brutally beaten by her father for impertinent behavior  toward  her  stepmother  (who  indulged  her  father\u2019s  habits),  then confined to  her room  for  half  a year.", "23": "Chang  contracted  dysentery, and her father denied her medical treatment.", "24": "In the throes of her illness, she suffered lurid hallucinations.\nIn 1939, some eighteen months after she\u2019d escaped from her father\u2019s house, Chang enrolled in the University of Hong Kong as a student of English literature.", "25": "She had hoped to go to London, but wartime conditions made that impossible.", "26": "War broke in on her studies anyway: the Japanese invaded Hong Kong in December 1941, at the same time that they attacked Pearl Harbor, and the university was shut down before she could complete her degree.", "27": "Chang returned to Shanghai, to the bright little apartment in which her aunt and mother lived.", "28": "She\u2019d been writing for some years, for school publications and the like; now she started publishing for pay in Shanghai\u2019s newspapers and magazines, first in English and then, quite spectacularly, in Chinese.", "29": "Shanghai then\u2014as now\u2014was the main cultural competitor to Beijing, and a huge gateway for new, imported ideas, especially in the realm of popular and middle-class entertainment.", "30": "During the Japanese occupation, however, the more intellectually ambitious writers either left the city or simply refrained from publication.", "31": "Chang stepped into that silence like a diva entering the limelight.", "32": "The public response was passionate \u2014fulsomely so, the sober critic Fu Lei complained, before going on to write a lengthy and careful consideration of all Chang\u2019s work to date, clearly the response of one serious writer to another.", "33": "She had already published a dozen stories in as many months, five of them ninety-page novellas, along with a steady stream of short, scintillating essays.", "34": "The stories were eventually collected in Romances (1944; revised edition in 1947) and the essays in Written on Water (1945).\nHu Lancheng, another influential man of letters, was so impressed by Chang\u2019s work (especially \u201cSealed Off,\u201d her modernist slice-of-life anti-romance) that he looked her up, swept her off her feet, and became her husband.", "35": "It was a secret marriage, however, witnessed only by two friends, because Hu Lancheng had served in the puppet government installed by the Japanese, and the political situation was very delicate.", "36": "After the Japanese were defeated, Hu Lancheng was indeed branded as a traitor, and Chang too was viewed with suspicion, even though their pact had dissolved in less than three years due to his sexual and emotional infidelities.\nHu Lancheng aside, Chang\u2019s response to the outburst of public adulation was one of cool bemusement.", "37": "She was a consummate performer, appearing in startling new outfits that she designed herself, alternately cajoling and flattering her readers, and turning out page after page of hauntingly precise, achingly beautiful fiction.", "38": "She offered wry, disturbing insights into various moral and mental conundrums, insights that were partly based on Freudian ideas, but probably were more deeply influenced by Chinese habits of thinking about human motives and manners\u2014a subject about which she learned much from traditional drama and fiction.", "39": "That grounding in older art was an essential part of her stylistic brilliance: Chang\u2019s great achievement was to meld the language and conventions of Qing dynasty vernacular fiction with the ironic, worldly stance of Edwardian British writers (there are several direct nods to H. G. Wells, and many echoes of Asian travelers like Somerset Maugham and Stella Benson), then project her stories by means of a visual imagination that had absorbed many scenes and techniques from the Hollywood films of her day.", "40": "The result was a rich, flexible, marvelously apt medium for exploring middle-class mentalities, both traditional and contemporary, in modern Shanghai.", "41": "Chang\u2019s worldly form of the sublime was achieved, we may say, by viewing her father\u2019s world from her mother\u2019s perspective, but with an artist\u2019s compassionate detachment.\nBut Chang\u2019s moment of fame was brief.", "42": "In Japanese-occupied Shanghai, she had stayed out of trouble with the authorities, and gained success with the public, by focusing on current manners and mores, avoiding any mention of the war or politics.", "43": "Surrounded by danger\u2014she knew at least one editor who was detained in an infamous prison, until Hu Lancheng intervened and obtained his release\u2014she masqueraded as a light, unserious writer.", "44": "Following the Japanese defeat, this stance made her vulnerable, especially to criticism from the socialist left.", "45": "In any case, given Chang\u2019s family background, it is unlikely that any stance of hers could have rendered her innocuous in the Communist Party\u2019s eyes.", "46": "She was too clearly a product of the privileged elite, even if now she had no financial resources beyond her meager earnings as a writer.", "47": "The pressures in Shanghai grew, and in 1952, Chang fled to Hong Kong, where eventually she accepted a job as a translator and fiction writer for the United States Information Service.", "48": "Propaganda was not her preferred form of literature, but she managed to write a pair of nuanced and complex \u201canti-Communist\u201d novels: The Rice Sprout Song and Naked Earth.", "49": "In 1955, she was awarded entry into the United States.\nChang was thirty-two when she left her beloved Shanghai for the last time.", "50": "For the following three decades, she was a banned writer in her homeland, though still much loved by loyal readers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese communities.", "51": "She tried, with little success, to break into the English-language fiction market, most notably with The Rouge of the North, a reworked version of her celebrated novella \"The Golden Cangue.\"", "52": "But the cultural and linguistic gaps were too wide to cross.", "53": "As C. T. Hsia, one of her earliest and most perceptive advocates, remarked (in A History of Modern Chinese Fiction), mid-century American readers' views of China were greatly influenced by writers like Pearl S. Buck, which left them unprepared for Chang's melancholy incisiveness and insider's perspective.\nShortly after arriving in the United States, Chang met and married a minor American playwright and novelist, Ferdinand Reyher, and the two of them traveled from one temporary residence to another.", "54": "Reyher died in 1967, and over the next three decades Chang retreated into deepening seclusion, but never stopped writing.", "55": "Working mostly through her Taiwan publisher, she kept turning out essays, translations, film scripts, and, less frequently, new fiction.\nDuring the last years of her life, while Chang was shunning visitors and even old friends, a \u201cChang craze\u201d was starting to build not just in Taiwan and Hong Kong but in the liberalizing People\u2019s Republic of China, too.", "56": "The news of her death\u2014alone in a scantily furnished Los Angeles apartment, in September of 1995\u2014was a major media event, and prompted a flood of reappraisals, adaptations, and biographical speculations.", "57": "It was as if Chinese readers were trying to make up for the decades of neglect that Chang had suffered since the 1940s.", "58": "The \u201ccraze\u201d continues throughout the Chinese-speaking world, and Eileen Chang\u2019s place in the pantheon of modern writers is now firmly assured.", "59": "If American readers are just now beginning to hear of this literary star who lived half of her life in deep obscurity, we can easily attribute this fact to Chang\u2019s own shyness, and to the political circumstances of her career.\nThe four novellas that form the core of this collection are the most sustained and widely acclaimed efforts in Chang\u2019s first volume of fiction, Chuanqi.", "60": "(I\u2019ve followed the usual translation, \u201cRomances,\u201d but the title could easily be rendered instead as \u201cLegends,\u201d very much in the sense of \u201curban legends\u201d).", "61": "Many readers feel this is the point at which Chang\u2019s talent shone most brightly; it is at any rate the period for which she has become a cultural icon.", "62": "The choice of shorter works was not so simple, as there are many of great interest.", "63": "In the end I chose two, \u201cJasmine Tea\u201d and \u201cSealed Off,\u201d that seem to me to make transitions between, and serve as complements to, the novellas.", "64": "Two other important stories, \u201cTraces of Love\u201d and \u201cSteamed Osmanthus Flower,\u201d could have come after \u201cRed Rose, White Rose,\u201d both logically and chronologically, but fortunately they have already been published in Traces of Love and Other Stories, edited by Eva Hung.\nDr. Hung was the first editor of my Chang translations during her tenure as editor of Renditions, the Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s translation magazine.", "65": "I am grateful for her early guidance through that infinite number of small difficulties that are the art and essence of translation, and hope that she will approve of the changes I have made to \u201cLove in a Fallen City\u201d since she first published it.", "66": "Fortunately\u2014and thanks to C.T. Hsia\u2014we have here Chang\u2019s own fine translation of \u201cThe Golden Cangue\u201d to help us hear how the author herself thought it should appear in English.", "67": "If the reader finds that the timbre of that story is different from that in my translations, in ways that go beyond dialect difference (British or Hong Kong versus American English), this probably is because I\u2019ve pushed hard at commonplace idioms and metaphors, trying to find lively equivalents instead of letting them dissolve unobtrusively, as could well happen in a skilled Chinese reader\u2019s mind.", "68": "My excuse for this is that my Taiwanese students have often told me that Chang\u2019s Chinese is not easy for them to understand\u2014they belong, after all, to the full-fledged multimedia age, while Chang grew up in a world that was still deeply focused on books and writing.", "69": "It seems to me that if Chang is tantalizing but tough for young Chinese readers today, a translator ought to err on the side of \u201cover-translation,\u201d even though Chang herself (perhaps because translation was not her favorite mode of writing) rendered \u201cThe Golden Cangue\u201d in fairly plain, understated English.\nAnother translator whose work has been of great use to me is Carolyn Thompson Brown; her strong, spare version of \u201cRed Rose, White Rose\u201d (which she entitled \u201cRed Rose and White Rose\u201d) can be found in her American University dissertation on the novella.", "70": "Still, my deepest debts are to the many readers whose mindful attention to early drafts helped me improve, step by tiny step: Deirdre Sabina Knight, Kailin Wu, Tarn Pak Shan, Joy Chen, Shuchin Lin, Sarah Dettwiler, an anonymous reviewer, and, most of all, Edwin Frank.", "71": "To none of them, of course, should the remaining errors and infelicities be attributed.\nBeyond and between all the details that these readers and I have wrestled with, these translations are but one reader\u2019s attempt to articulate at least some part of the psychological and sensory experience that Eileen Chang\u2019s fiction has provoked in her mind and, judging from various sources, those of many Chinese readers.", "72": "Thus, these translations grow out of the central conviction that Chang\u2019s melding of Qing and Edwardian, patriarchal and feminist, past and present offers her readers a nuanced, historicized view of their own cultural moment, in all its singularity and repetitiveness.", "73": "Like the moon and the mirrors which figure so prominently in her work, Chang\u2019s stories themselves are a succession of echoes, or the infinite series produced by a three-way mirror, recalling and restoring an ancient, anterior sense of selfhood in the midst of modernist, wartime rupture and dislocation.", "74": "Even if our times are different now (and I\u2019m not sure that they are), a vision like this is both unsettling and satisfying.\n\u2014KAREN S.

the room.", "599": "The azalea was densely packed with flowers, and the cigarette butt fell among them, scorching a petal brown.\nWeilong stood alone in the living room until a junior maid came in and called her to breakfast.", "600": "After breakfast, she went upstairs and stood at the window of her room, gazing vacantly.", "601": "There was the rectangular grass lawn, neatly trimmed, sprinkled with dew, a bold deep green.", "602": "With sharp jerky steps, a sparrow was crossing the lawn, only to stop along the way, as if dazed by that continent of stupefying green.", "603": "Step by jerky step, it started back.", "604": "Weilong had thought that sparrows only hopped; she had never realized that they could move in long, measured strides, and she watched for a long time.", "605": "Perhaps it wasn\u2019t a sparrow?", "606": "She was still wondering when two porters passed down the garden path, puffing as they carried a red trunk through the gate.", "607": "They were followed by a middle-aged woman in a tunic and trousers of black gambiered silk; Glance\u2019s mother, apparently.", "608": "Glance came out too and just stood there.", "609": "She was waiting, it seemed, for another porter who was still inside.", "610": "Her eyes were red and swollen from crying, and her powder had turned her face to a light brown.", "611": "Weilong could only see her in profile, eyes staring straight ahead, face expressionless, a clay mask.", "612": "After watching for some time, Weilong noticed the slight twitch of a muscle running from cheek to temple.", "613": "Oh, so that was it: Glance was eating peanuts.", "614": "Every once in a while a shred of red peanut skin would pop out of the corner of her mouth.\nSuddenly Weilong didn't want to watch anymore.", "615": "She turned and opened the closet door, leaning against it.", "616": "It was dark inside the closet, and the lilac scent made her dizzy.", "617": "The air of the faraway past was in there\u2014decorous, languid, heedless of time.", "618": "In that closet there was no bright, clear morning like the one outside the window, with its flat green grass, mute frightened face, and peanut skins at the corner of the mouth\u2026 all that dirty, complicated, unreasonable reality.\nOnce Weilong had gone into that clothes closet, she stayed for two or three months, and she had lots of opportunities to dress up.", "619": "A banquet, a tea party, a concert, a mah-jongg party\u2014for her these were little more than occasions for putting on fine clothes.", "620": "She considered herself fortunate, since Madame Liang merely used her as a signboard to attract the mainstream sort of youth.", "621": "Her aunt did take her to fancy dance halls a few times, but usually she invited people over to the house.", "622": "Steeped as they are in the conservative habits of the British upper class, the young ladies of Hong Kong\u2019s great families maintain an air of dignified reserve, quite unlike Shanghai\u2019s socialites.\nMadame Liang was extremely picky about the young men who pursued Weilong, more severe even than the imperial household when it is choosing a royal son-in-law.", "623": "If the lucky half dozen who were in the running grew excessively ardent in their pursuit, Madame Liang simply took the precious goods off the shelf: none of the suitors would be allowed to go near her niece.", "624": "Then, when she had permitted one of them to get close, she swooped in with a dexterous display of charm, and recruited him for her own purposes.", "625": "When a youth paid his addresses to Madame Liang, he was like an old drunk who pretends he doesn\u2019t want a drink; in the end, he succumbed, and there he\u2019d be, deep in an affair.", "626": "Weilong got used to watching this little drama, without caring much about it.\nOne day, as she was preparing to go out, Weilong urged Glint to do up her hair quickly.", "627": "Madame Liang had assigned her favorite attendant to wait on Weilong, and Glint had quickly got a very good grasp of Weilong\u2019s temperament.", "628": "Weilong, with no family in Hong Kong to turn to, had found that Glint, though she could be quite cold-hearted, always had warm, wise advice for her.", "629": "Glint was now her trusted confidante.\n\u201cHow about the dress first and then the hair?\u201d Glint said now.", "630": "\u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll muss your hair when you pull the dress over your head.\u201d", "631": "\u201cPick out something simple,\u201d Weilong said. \u201cThe choir is going to practice in the church, and I\u2019m afraid the people there won\u2019t approve of fancy clothes.\u201d", "632": "But Glint went ahead and chose a ginger-yellow crepe cheongsam. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not a Christian, so why join the choir? Your social schedule keeps you busy all day long, and then you study till dawn. These past two weeks you\u2019ve been working so hard to get ready for your exams that you\u2019re positively wasting away! Why are you ruining your health this way?\u201d", "633": "Weilong sighed and dipped her chin to let Glint part her hair. \u201cYou say I\u2019m studying too much. But you know very well that I go out to parties just to help my aunt and keep her happy. I worked very hard for this chance to study, so now I have to do a good job and get respectable grades.\u201d", "634": "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to rain on your parade, but what is the point of graduating? You\u2019re still in secondary school, Hong Kong has only one university, and university graduates can\u2019t find work anyway! If they do find a job, it pays fifty or sixty dollars a month, and for that they have to teach in a primary school run by the church and put up with the foreign nuns\u2019 bad tempers. It\u2019s really not worth it!\u201d", "635": "\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t thought of all that? Still, I have to take what I can get!\u201d", "636": "\u201cNow don\u2019t get angry at what I\u2019m going to say. I think you should use all these social occasions to look around and find someone who\u2019ll be right for you.\u201d", "637": "Weilong smiled sarcastically. \u201cAnd who would that be, in my aunt\u2019s circle of friends? They\u2019re either young men as slippery as dance-hall playboys or the kind of old man who likes to hang around a harem. Or else they\u2019re British military men, in which case, if they\u2019re lieutenants or above, they don\u2019t want to get involved with someone from the yellow race. That\u2019s how it is in Hong Kong!\u201d", "638": "\u201cOh, now I get it!\u201d Glint responded with a sudden laugh. \u201cNo wonder you joined the choir even though you don\u2019t have any free time. They say there are quite a few college students in that group.\u201d", "639": "\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you joke about this with me,\u201d Weilong smiled. \u201cBut don\u2019t go saying anything to Aunt!\u201d", "640": "Glint was silent.", "641": "\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Weilong was insistent. \u201cDon\u2019t go spreading rumors!\u201d", "642": "Glint was startled out of her reverie. \u201cWhat do you take me for? You think I can\u2019t keep quiet about a little thing like this?\u201d She glanced around, then said quietly, \u201cMiss, you\u2019d better be careful. While you\u2019ve been looking for someone to pick, our Young Mistress, with her sharp eyes and quick fingers, has already picked one out for herself.\u201d", "643": "Weilong looked up sharply, knocking Glint\u2019s hand aside. \u201cWho do you mean?\u201d", "644": "\u201cThat Lu Somebody in your choir, the one who\u2019s good at tennis. He\u2019s a college student, isn\u2019t he? Oh, now I remember, his name is Lu Zhaolin.\u201d", "645": "Weilong\u2019s face flushed bright red; she bit her lips in silence. Finally, she said, \u201cHow do you know that she\u2026\u201d", "646": "\u201cEh! How could I not know? If it weren\u2019t for this, she wouldn\u2019t have let you join the choir in the first place. She wouldn\u2019t let you go off on your own to make friends, not even to sing with a big group of people in the church. That\u2019s the rule here. Anyone who wants to see you has to come in through the front door and pay a proper visit. And once they\u2019ve come in that way, it\u2019s easy to manage things. I thought it was strange when she didn\u2019t say anything about your joining the choir. Two weeks ago, all she could talk about was holding a garden party and inviting your choir friends, so everyone would have a chance to get acquainted. Then that Lu person went to Manila for a tennis match, and the garden party was put off. As soon as Lu came back, she started talking about it again. As for the real purpose of tomorrow\u2019s party, well, of course you\u2019ve been kept in the dark!\u201d", "647": "Weilong ground her teeth. \u201cIf he falls for her sweet-talking and goes off with her, then he\u2019s not someone who can be trusted. I\u2019ll see through his act right away. Probably just as well.\u201d", "648": "\u201cYou\u2019re being foolish,\u201d Glint said. \u201cCrows will be black, wherever you go; men will always fall for this kind of bait. Don\u2019t forget\u2014your Mr. Lu is young, a student, probably inexperienced. If he falls for this, you can hardly blame him. Write him a letter, if you know him well enough. Ask him not to come tomorrow.\u201d", "649": "\u201cKnow him!\u201d Weilong smiled blandly. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely spoken to each other!\u201d She let the matter drop.\nThe garden party was on the following day.", "650": "There\u2019s a touch of nineteenth-century England in every garden party.", "651": "In England the skies are hardly ever clear, but when at last the balmy summer days do arrive, the lords and ladies hold these sorts of semiformal parties on their country estates.", "652": "The ladies wear straw hats with broad floppy brims, corsages of old-fashioned artificial flowers, and elbow-length silk gloves, all very fancy, just as if they were attending a formal court function.", "653": "Anyone in the county with the least claim to status is sure to attend, and the local minister and his wife show up to bow and scrape.", "654": "Decked out in their finery, the company paces about the castle grounds and through the rocky ruins, engaging in stiff conversation.", "655": "Then, after tea, they beg some young ladies to play the piano and sing \u201cThe Last Rose of Summer.\u201d", "656": "Hong Kong garden parties are even better.", "657": "Hong Kong society copies English custom in every respect, but goes on adding further touches until the original conception is entirely lost.", "658": "Madame Liang\u2019s garden party was garishly swathed in local color.", "659": "\u201cGood luck\u201d paper lanterns had been planted on five-foot poles all around the lawn;

the atmosphere was prim and proper.", "663": "Given the religious nature of the choir, half a dozen Catholic nuns had also been invited.", "664": "The monks and nuns of Hong Kong are used to attending social events, and they know how to mingle; they have lively, pleasing manners.", "665": "These nuns, however, were not as brilliant as some, and they spoke only French and Latin.", "666": "Since Weilong was taking French at school and had picked up a few phrases, Madame Liang dispatched her to entertain them.\nWeilong watched helplessly as Lu Zhaolin arrived.", "667": "Madame Liang, gorgeously attired, took his hand and, blinking in the bright sun, said something Weilong couldn\u2019t hear.", "668": "Lu Zhaolin left his hand in Madame Liang\u2019s, but he glanced about, searching for Weilong.", "669": "Madame Liang\u2019s sharp eyes found her first.", "670": "Madame Liang\u2019s gaze slid from Lu Zhaolin to Weilong, then back to Lu Zhaolin.", "671": "Weilong gave Lu Zhaolin a forced smile.", "672": "He was a tall, broad-shouldered, dark-skinned youth; when he smiled in return his white teeth flashed in the sun.\nThen the wind changed, and started blowing toward Weilong; she could just hear Madame Liang saying, \u201cPoor child!\nShe hardly ever gets a chance to use her French.\nLet\u2019s not bother her while she\u2019s having fun.\u201d\nWith that, she led him off, and they disappeared into the crowd.\nThe second time Weilong caught sight of them, they were sitting under a blue-and-white-striped beach umbrella.", "673": "Madame Liang\u2019s elbows were propped on the table;

it was a flat white, altogether opaque.", "680": "A snow-white face with large, pale-green eyes hinting of mischief, jet eyebrows and lashes, and full, luscious, scarlet lips\u2014a face of almost forbidding beauty.", "681": "This was Zhou Jijie, peerless among the party girls in Hong Kong\u2019s younger set.", "682": "Her genealogy was said to be very complicated;

She wanted to win him over so he\u2019d keep his mouth shut.", "3840": "But in fact Zhenbao had no intention of interfering in their private lives. It wasn\u2019t that his bond with Wang Shihong was too weak\u2014even if they\u2019d been blood brothers, stirring up disputes between a husband and wife was not his style.", "3841": "Even so, this woman could cause a lot of trouble.
